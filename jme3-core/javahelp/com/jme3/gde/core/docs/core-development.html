        <h1>Devloping plugins for jMonkeyPlatform</h1>
        <p>
            In general, developing plugins for jMonkeyPlatform is not much different than creating plugins for the NetBeans Platform which in turn is not much different than creating Swing applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            So if you feel like you want to make an addition to jMonkeyPlatform dont hesitate to contact the jme team regardless of your knowledge in NetBeans platform development. For new plugins, the basic project creation and layout of the plugin can always be handled by a core developer and you can go on from there creating a jme / swing application like you are used to.
            <br/>Note however that by using the Platform functions, your plugin feels more like a Platform application (global save button, file type support etc.).
        </p>
