<h1><a>Spatial</a></h1>
<div>

<p>

This is an introduction to the concept of of Spatials, the elements of the 3D scene graph. The scene graph is a data structure that manages all objects in your 3D world. For example it keeps track of the 3D models that you load and position. When you extend a Java class from com.jme3.app.SimpleApplication, you inherit the scene graph and rootNode. 
</p>

<p>
The main element of the scene graph is a Spatial called rootNode. All other Spatials are <em>attached</em> to the rootNode in a parent-child relationship. If you think you want to understand the scene graph better, please read <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/scenegraph_for_dummies.html">Scenegraph for dummies</a> first.

<h2><a>Node versus Geometry</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

A Spatial is either a Node or a Geometry.

<table>

		<td>  </td><th> Spatials </th>

	<tr>
		<th> Purpose: </th><td> A Spatial is an abstract data structure that stores transformations (translation, rotation, scale) of elements of the scene graph. A Spatial can be saved and loaded using the AssetManager. </td>

		<td>  </td><th> com.jme3.scene.Geometry </th><th> com.jme3.scene.Node </th>

		<th> Visibility: </th><td> A Geometry represents a visible 3-D object in the scene graph. </td><td> A Node is an invisible “handle” for a group of objects in the scene graph. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th> Purpose:    </th><td> Use Geometries to represent an object&#039;s looks: Every Geometry contains a polygon mesh and a material, specifying its shape, color, texture, and opacity/transparency. <br/>
 You can attach a Geometry to an Node. </td><td> Use nodes to structure and group Geometries and other Nodes. Every Node is attached to parent node, and the node can have children attached to itself. When you transform a parent node, all its children are transformed as well. </td>
	</tr>

<p>

<strong>Important:</strong> You never create a Spatial with <code>Spatial s = new Spatial();</code> – it&#039;s abstract. Instead you create (e.g. load) a Node or Geometry object, and cast it to Spatial. You use the Spatial type in methods that accept both Nodes and Geometries as arguments.

<h3><a>Mesh</a></h3>
<div>

<p>

The polygon <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/advanced/mesh.html">Mesh</a> inside a Geometry can be one of three things:

</p>
<ul>
<li><div> <strong>Shapes:</strong> The simplest type of Meshes are jME&#039;s default <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/advanced/shape.html">Shape</a>s such as cubes and spheres. You can use several Shapes to build complex Geometries. Shapes are built-in and can be created without using the AssetManager.</div>
</li>
<li><div> <strong>3D Models:</strong> <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/advanced/3d_models.html">3D models and scenes</a> are also made up of meshes, but are more complex than Shapes. You create Models and Scenes in external 3D Mesh Editors and export them as Ogre <acronym title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> or Wavefront OBJ. Use the <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/advanced/asset_manager.html">Asset Manager</a> to load models into a your jME3 game.</div>
</li>
<li><div> <strong>Custom Meshes:</strong> Advanced users can create <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/advanced/custom_meshes.html">Custom Meshes</a> programmatically.</div>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2><a>How to Access a Named Sub-Mesh</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

Often after you load a scene or model, you need to access a part of it as an individual Geometry in the scene graph. Maybe you want to swap a character&#039;s weapon, or you want to play a door-opening animation. First you need to know the unique name of the sub-mesh.

</p>
<ol>
<li><div> Open the model in a 3D mesh editor, or in the jMonkeyPlatform&#039;s viewer. </div>
</li>
<li><div> Find out the existing names of sub-meshes in the model.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Assign unique names to sub-meshes in the model if neccessary.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>

In the following example, the Node <code>house</code> is the loaded model. The sub-meshes in the Node are called its children. The String, here <code>door 12</code>, is the name of the mesh that you are searching. 
</p>
<pre>Geometry submesh = &#40;Geometry&#41; houseScene.getChild&#40;&quot;door 12&quot;&#41;;</pre>
