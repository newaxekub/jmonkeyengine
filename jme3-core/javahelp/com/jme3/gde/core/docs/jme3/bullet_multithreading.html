With computers having multiple cores nowadays, it seems feasible to let the physics run on a separate thread. However, there are some implications and plain multithreading is not always the solution for problems but bring on new ones.
</p>

<p>
Multithreading is misunderstood by many programmers nowadays. The secret is not to have separate detached logical loops going on in parallel and have them communicate about their state (Like one thread AI, one Sound, one Graphics) but to have a normal “loop” for logic and then just multithread within that loop when its appropriate. Each for loop in the main loop might be a chance for MT&#039;ing, this scales way better to multiple cores and does not break up code logic. So ideally, the physics system makes use of multiple cores itself and is still included in a “normal” update order. Since bullet is not (yet) multithreaded or GPU accelerated the jME3 implementation allows some ways to run the physics on a separate thread. These are described here.

A SimpleApplication with a BulletAppState allows setting the threading type via 
</p>
<pre class="code">setThreadingType(ThreadingType type);</pre>

<p>
 where ThreadingType can be either SEQUENTIAL, PARALLEL or DETACHED.
</p>

<p>
In the simpleInitApp() method:
</p>
<pre class="code java">bulletAppState <span class="sy0">=</span> <span class="kw1">new</span> BulletAppState<span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span>;

<p>

This solution comes close to the “one loop /w parallel computations” way I described before. Here the physics update happens in parallel to rendering, after the users changes have been made in the update() call. This way the loop logic is still maintained: the user can set and change values in physics and scenegraph objects before render() and physicsUpdate() are called in parallel.
This is the “standard” form of multithreading since it will produce less problems for users.

<p>
This mode lets the physics update loop run completely separate on another thread and the location/rotation of the single physics objects (via the MotionState) is atomized. This way the scenegraph loop can safely get and set these values. However all physics parameters have still to be changed from the physics thread and adding/removing of objects has to happen via the physics thread.
The updatePhysics() method is called by a separate thread and you have to care for yourself that you access the physics parameters of a PhysicsNode from the physics thread and the “rest” of the parameters via the opengl thread.

<p>
In the future, I hope that when I have integrated the native bullet version with OpenCL support etc. the PARALLEL solution or even the SEQUENTIAL solution becomes the standard way of doing things as the boost in performance from the graphics card should beat the boost from using another CPU by far.
