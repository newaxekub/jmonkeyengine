<p>
Common interactions in games include shooting, picking up objects, and opening doors. 
</p>

<p>
From an implementation point of view, these apparently different interactions are very similar: The user first aims and selects a target in the 3D scene, and then triggers an action on it. We call that picking.
</p>

<p>
You can pick something by either pressing a key on the keyboard, or by clicking with the mouse. In either case, you identify the target by aiming a ray –a straight line– into the scene. This method to implement picking is called <em>ray casting</em> (not the same as <em>ray tracing</em>).

<p>
You should see four colored cubes floating over a gray floor, and cross-hairs. Aim the cross-hairs and click, or press the spacebar to shoot. The last hit will be marked with a red dot.
</p>

<p>
Keep an eye on the application&#039;s output stream, it will give you more details: The name of the mesh that was hit, the coordinates of the hit, and the distance.
</p>

</div>

<h2><a>Understanding the Helper Methods</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

The methods <code>makeCube()</code>,  <code>makeFloor()</code>, <code>initMark()</code>, and <code>initCrossHairs</code>, are custom helper methods. We call them from  <code>simpleInitApp()</code> to initialize the scenegraph with sample content.
 
</p>
<ol>
<li><div> <code>makeCube()</code> creates simple colored boxes for “target practice”. </div>
</li>
<li><div> <code>makeFloor()</code> creates a gray floor node for “target practice”. </div>
</li>
<li><div> <code>initMark()</code> creates a red sphere (“mark”). We will use it later to mark the spot that was hit. </div>
<ul>
<li><div> Note that the mark is not attached and therefor not visible at the start.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> <code>initCrossHairs()</code> creates simple cross-hairs by printing a ”+” sign in the middle of the screen. </div>
<ul>
<li><div> Note that the cross-hairs are attached to the <code>guiNode</code>, not to the <code>rootNode</code>.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>

In this example, we attached all “shootable” objects to one custom node, <code>Shootables</code>. This is an optimization so the engine only has to calculate intersections with objects we are actually interested in.  The <code>Shootables</code> node is attached to the <code>rootNode</code> as usual.
</p>

</div>

<h2><a>Understanding Ray Casting for Hit Testing</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

Our goal is to determine which box the user “shot” (picked). In general, we want to determine which mesh the user has selected by aiming the cross-hairs at it. Mathematically, we draw a line from the camera and see whether it intersects with objects in the 3D scene. This line is called a ray.
</p>

<p>
Here is our simple ray casting algorithm for picking objects:

</p>
<ol>
<li><div> Reset the results list.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Cast a ray from cam location into the cam direction.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Collect all intersections between the ray and <code>Shootable</code> nodes in the <code>results</code> list.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Use the results list to determine what was hit:</div>
<ol>
<li><div> For each hit, JME reports its distance from the camera, impact point, and the name of the mesh.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Sort the results by distance.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Take the closest result, it is the mesh that was hit.</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

</div>

<h2><a>Implementing Hit Testing</a></h2>
<div>

</div>

<h3><a>Loading the scene</a></h3>
<div>

<p>

First initialize some shootable nodes and attach them to the scene. You will use the <code>mark</code> object later.
</p>
<pre>  Node shootables;
  Geometry mark;
&nbsp;
  @Override
  public void simpleInitApp&#40;&#41; &#123;
    initCrossHairs&#40;&#41;;
    initKeys&#40;&#41;;
    initMark&#40;&#41;; 
    shootables = new Node&#40;&quot;Shootables&quot;&#41;;
    rootNode.attachChild&#40;shootables&#41;;
    shootables.attachChild&#40;makeCube&#40;&quot;a Dragon&quot;,    -2f, 0f, 1f&#41;&#41;;
    shootables.attachChild&#40;makeCube&#40;&quot;a tin can&quot;,    1f,-2f, 0f&#41;&#41;;
    shootables.attachChild&#40;makeCube&#40;&quot;the Sheriff&quot;,  0f, 1f,-2f&#41;&#41;;
    shootables.attachChild&#40;makeCube&#40;&quot;the Deputy&quot;,   1f, 0f, -4&#41;&#41;;
    shootables.attachChild&#40;makeFloor&#40;&#41;&#41;;
  &#125;</pre>
</div>

<h3><a>Setting Up the Input Listener</a></h3>
<div>

<p>

Next you declare the shooting action. It can be triggered either by clicking, or by pressing the space bar. The <code>initKeys()</code> method is called from <code>simpleInitApp()</code> to set up these input mappings.
</p>
<pre>  /** Declaring the &quot;Shoot&quot; action and its triggers. */
  private void initKeys&#40;&#41; &#123;
    inputManager.addMapping&#40;&quot;Shoot&quot;,      // Declare...
      new KeyTrigger&#40;KeyInput.KEY_SPACE&#41;, // trigger 1: spacebar, or
      new MouseButtonTrigger&#40;0&#41;&#41;;         // trigger 2: left-button click
    inputManager.addListener&#40;actionListener, &quot;Shoot&quot;&#41;; // ... and add.
  &#125;</pre>
</div>

<h3><a>Defining the Picking Action</a></h3>
<div>

<p>

Next we implement the ActionListener that responds to the Shoot trigger with an action. The action follows the ray casting algorithm described above:

</p>
<ol>
<li><div> For every click or press of the spacebar, the <code>Shoot</code> action is triggered.</div>
</li>
<li><div> The action casts a ray forward and determines intersections with shootable objects (= ray casting).</div>
</li>
<li><div> For any target that has been hit, it prints name, distance, and coordinates of the hit.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Finally it attaches a red mark to the closest result, to highlight the spot that was actually hit.</div>
</li>
<li><div> When nothing was hit, the results list is empty, and the red mark is removed.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>

Note how it prints a lot of output to show you which hits were registered. 
</p>
<pre>  /** Defining the &quot;Shoot&quot; action: Determine what was hit and how to respond. */
  private ActionListener&#40;&#41; &#123;
    @Override
    public void onAction&#40;String name, boolean keyPressed, float tpf&#41; &#123;
      if &#40;name.equals&#40;&quot;Shoot&quot;&#41; &amp;&amp; !keyPressed&#41; &#123;
        // 1. Reset results list.
        CollisionResults results = new CollisionResults&#40;&#41;;
        // 2. Aim the ray from cam loc to cam direction.
        Ray ray = new Ray&#40;cam.getLocation&#40;&#41;, cam.getDirection&#40;&#41;&#41;;
        // 3. Collect intersections between Ray and Shootables in results list.
        shootables.collideWith&#40;ray, results&#41;;
        // 4. Print results.
        System.out.println&#40;&quot;----- Collisions? &quot; + results.size&#40;&#41; + &quot;-----&quot;&#41;;
        for &#40;int i = 0; i &lt; results.size&#40;&#41;; i++&#41; &#123;
          // For each hit, we know distance, impact point, name of geometry.
          float dist = results.getCollision&#40;i&#41;.getDistance&#40;&#41;;
          Vector3f pt = results.getCollision&#40;i&#41;.getContactPoint&#40;&#41;;
          String hit = results.getCollision&#40;i&#41;.getGeometry&#40;&#41;.getName&#40;&#41;;
          System.out.println&#40;&quot;* Collision #&quot; + i&#41;;
          System.out.println&#40;&quot;  You shot &quot; + hit + &quot; at &quot; + pt + &quot;, &quot; + dist + &quot; wu away.&quot;&#41;;
        &#125;
        // 5. Use the results (we mark the hit object)
        if &#40;results.size&#40;&#41; &gt; 0&#41;&#123;
          // The closest collision point is what was truly hit:
          CollisionResult closest = results.getClosestCollision&#40;&#41;;
          mark.setLocalTranslation&#40;closest.getContactPoint&#40;&#41;&#41;;
          // Let's interact - we mark the hit with a red dot.
          rootNode.attachChild&#40;mark&#41;;
        &#125; else &#123;
        // No hits? Then remove the red mark.
          rootNode.detachChild&#40;mark&#41;;
        &#125;
      &#125;
    &#125;
  &#125;;</pre>
<p>
Tip: Notice how you use the provided method <code>results.getClosestCollision().getContactPoint()</code> to determine the <em>closest</em> hit&#039;s location. If your game includes a “weapon” or “spell” that can hit multiple targets, you would instead loop over the list of results, and interact with each of them. 
</p>

</div>

<h2><a>Exercises</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

After a hit was registered, the closest object is identified as target, and marked with a red dot. 
Modify the code sample to solve these exercises:
</p>

</div>

<h3><a>Magic Spell</a></h3>
<div>

<p>

Change the color of the closest clicked target! <br/>
 Here are some tips:
</p>
<ol>
<li><div> Go to the line where the closest target is indentified, and add you changes after that.</div>
</li>
<li><div> To change an object&#039;s color, you must first know its node. Identify the node by identifying the target&#039;s name.</div>
<ul>
<li><div> Use <code>rootNode.getChild(closest.getGeometry().getName())</code></div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> Create a new color material and set the node&#039;s Material to this color.</div>
<ul>
<li><div> Look inside the <code>makeCube()</code> method for an example of how to set random colors.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

</div>

<h3><a>Shoot at a Character</a></h3>
<div>

<p>

Shooting boxes isn&#039;t very exciting – can you add code that loads and positions a model in the scene, and shoot at it?
</p>
<ul>
<li><div> Tip: You can use <code>Spatial golem = assetManager.loadModel(“Models/Oto/Oto.mesh.xml”);</code> from the engine&#039;s jme3-test-data.jar.</div>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3><a>Pick up into Inventory</a></h3>
<div>

<p>

Change the code as follows to simulate the player picking up objects into the inventory: When you click once, the closest target is identified and detached from the scene. When you click a second time, the target is reattached at the location that you have clicked. Here are some tips:
</p>
<ol>
<li><div> Create an inventory node to store the detached nodes. </div>
</li>
<li><div> The inventory node is not attached to the rootNode. </div>
</li>
<li><div> You can make the inventory visible by attaching the inventory node to the guiNode. </div>
</li>
</ol>

</div>

<h2><a>Conclusion</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

You have learned how to use ray casting to solve the task of determining what object a user selected on the screen. You learned that this can be used for a variety of interactions, such as shooting, opening, picking up and dropping items, pressing a button or lever, etc. 
</p>

<p>
Use your imagination from here: 
</p>
<ul>
<li><div> In your game, the click can trigger any action on the identified object: Detach it and put it into the inventory, attach something to it, trigger an animation or effect, open a door or crate, – etc.</div>
</li>
<li><div> In your game, you could replace the red mark with a particle emitter, add an explosion effect, play a sound, calculate the new score after each hit depending on what was hit – etc. </div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

Now, wouldn&#039;t it be nice if those targets and the floor were solid objects and you could walk among them? Let&#039;s continue with <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/beginner/hello_collision.html">Collision Detection</a>.
