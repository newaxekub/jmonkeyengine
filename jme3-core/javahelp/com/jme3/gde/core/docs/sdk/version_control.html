<h1><a>jMonkeyPlatform: Version Control</a></h1>
<div>

<p>

Whether you work in a development team or alone: File versioning is a handy method to keep your code consistent, compare files line-by-line, and even roll back unwanted changes. This documentation shows you how to make the most of the jMonkeyPlatform&#039;s integrated version control features for Subversion, Mercurial, and <acronym title="Concurrent Versions System">CVS</acronym>.
</p>

<p>
<br/>

</p>

<p>
Note: Since the jMonkeyPlatform is based on the NetBeans Platform framework, you can learn about certain jMonkeyPlatform features by reading the corresponding NetBeans IDE tutorials (in the “see also links”). 
</p>

</div>

<h2><a>Version Control Systems</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

The jMonkeyPlatform supports various Version Control Systems such as Subversion, Mercurial, and <acronym title="Concurrent Versions System">CVS</acronym>. No matter which of them you use, they all share a common user interface.
</p>

<p>
You can use file versioning alone or in a team. The advantages are that you can keep track of changes (who did it, when, and why), you can compare versions line-by-line, you can revert changes to files and lines, merge multiple changes to one file, and you can even undelete files.
</p>

<h2><a>Creating a Repository (Upload)</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

Requirements: 
</p>
<ul>
<li><div> You must have a project that you want to version. </div>
</li>
<li><div> You must have version control software installed (Subversion, Mercurial, or <acronym title="Concurrent Versions System">CVS</acronym>) and have initialized a repository.</div>
<ul>
<li><div> Tip: For Subversion, the init command looks like this example: <code>svnadmin create /home/joe/mysvnrepo</code></div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> The computer where the repository is to be hosted must be available in your network, or you will only be able to use your repo locally.</div>
<ul>
<li><div> Tip: Hosts such as SourceForge, GoogleCode, dev.java.net offer free version control services for open-source projects.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

Now you create a repository to store your project&#039;s files. 

</p>
<ol>
<li><div> In the jMonkeyPlatform, right-click the project in the Projects window and choose Versioning &gt; Import Into <acronym title="Concurrent Versions System">CVS</acronym>/Subversion Repository (or initialize Mercurial Project, respectively). </div>
<ul>
<li><div> Tip: If you haven&#039;t evaluated yet which system to choose, start with Subversion for now.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> Go through the wizard and fill in the fields to set up the repository.</div>
</li>
</ol>

</div>

<h2><a>Checking Out a Repository (Download)</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

You and your team mates check out (download) the repository to their individual workstations. 

</p>
<ol>
<li><div> Go to the Team menu and choose Subversion &gt; Checkout (or <acronym title="Concurrent Versions System">CVS</acronym>/Mercurial&gt;Checkout respectively)</div>
</li>
<li><div> Fill in your repo data into the wizard and click Finish.</div>
<ul>
<li><div> A typical repository <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym> looks like this example: <code><object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer"><param name="content" value="http://jmonkeyengine.googlecode.com/svn/branches/jme3"><param name="text" value="<html><u>http://jmonkeyengine.googlecode.com/svn/branches/jme3</u></html>"><param name="textColor" value="blue"></object></code></div>
</li>
<li><div> If you want to be able to submit changes, you must have a username and password to this repository. Otherwise leave these fields blank.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> The repository is downloaded and stored in the location you chose. </div>
</li>
<li><div> Use the File &gt; Open Project menu to open the checkout as project and start working. </div>
<ul>
<li><div> If the checkout is not recognized you need to choose File &gt; New Project from Existing Sources</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
 
<br/>

Of course you can also check out existing repositories and access code from other open-source projects (e.g. SourceForge, GoogleCode, dev.java.net). 
</p>

</div>

<h2><a>Updating and Committing Changes (Send and Receive)</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

Receiving the latest changes from the team&#039;s repository is referred to as <code>updating</code>. Sending your changes to the team&#039;s repository is refered to as <code>commiting</code>.

</p>
<ol>
<li><div> Before making changes, right-click the project and select Subversion &gt; Update to make sure you have the latest revision.</div>
<ul>
<li><div> Get in the habit of updating regularly, always before you edit a version controlled file. It will spare you much grief.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> After making changes to the project, make certain your change did not break anything.</div>
<ol>
<li><div> Update, build, run, test.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Look at the red/green/blue marks in the editor to review what you have deleted/added/changed. Click the marks to review all differences in a file.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Choose Subversion &gt; Show Changes to see all files that were recently changed – by you and other team members. </div>
</li>
<li><div> <em>Update again</em> in case your team mates made changes while you were reviewing.</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><div> If there are no conflicts and you want to commit your changes, choose Subversion &gt; Commit from the menu.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Write a commit message describing what you changed. </div>
<ul>
<li><div> Remember, you are writing “a message to your future self”. Never write redundant stuff like “I changed something”.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

</div>

<h2><a>Comparing and Reverting Changes</a></h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div> If you and another committer edited the same line, there is a conflict, and the jMonkeyPlatform will show an error message. </div>
<ul>
<li><div> Right-click a file Choose Subversion &gt; Resolve Conflict</div>
<ol>
<li><div> Compare the conflicting versions. Press the buttons to accept or reject each change individually. </div>
</li>
<li><div> After the resolver shows green, save the resolution.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Build and test the resolution, update, and commit.</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> Right-click a file and choose Subversion &gt; Search History.</div>
<ul>
<li><div> You can inspect a file&#039;s history and see who changed what, why, and when. </div>
</li>
<li><div> You can roll back a file to a historic version if necessary.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> In general, you can choose Subversion &gt; Diff for any file to see two versions of a file next to each other.</div>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2><a>No Version Control? Local History!</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

If you do not use any version control, you can still track changes in projects to a certain degree.

</p>
<ul>
<li><div> Right-click a file or directory and choose Local History to show or revert changes, or undelete files.</div>
</li>
<li><div> You can also select any two files in the Project window and choose Tools &gt; Diff to compare them.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Local History only works for files edited in jMonkeyPlatform Projects (It does not work for other files, e.g. in the Favorites window.)</div>
</li>
</ul>
