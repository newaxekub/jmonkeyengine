        <h2>Automatically Updating jMonkeyEngine SDK</h2>
        The jMonkeyPlatform software includes an automatic web update feature.
        To have your complete SDK being updated to the most current nightly version of jME3 and jMP do the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Go to Tools→Plugins</li>
            <li>Select the “Settings” tab</li>
            <li>Select the checkbox for “jMonkeyPlatform nightly svn”</li>
            <li>Select the “Updates” tab</li>
            <li>Press “Reload Catalog”</li>
            <li>Press “Update”</li>
        </ul>
        There you go, the jMP will check for updates in the intervals set on the “Settings” tab.
        Be warned however, the changes in the nightly versions might break your current game project if heavy changes have been committed.
