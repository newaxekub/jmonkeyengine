        <h2>What is the jMonkeyPlatform?</h2>
        <h2>About jMonkeyPlatform</h2>
        <p>
            The jMonkeyPlatform is a game development environment for the jMonkeyEngine 3.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since jMonkeyPlatform is based on the <a href="http://platform.netbeans.org/" class="urlextern" title="http://platform.netbeans.org/"  rel="nofollow">NetBeans Platform</a>
            you have access to all of the developer tools in the <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.netbeans.org/"  rel="nofollow">NetBeans IDE</a> to create, compile and deploy Java applications.
            On top of that, the jMonkeyPlatform provides you with specialized plugins for creating jMonkeyEngine 3 game content.
            The jMonkeyPlatform can be downloaded and installed as a ready-to-use complete game development environment, rather than just a generic IDE to work with raw source code.
        </p>

        <h2>What Does the jMonkeyPlatform Deliver?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>An integrated <acronym title="Software Development Kit">SDK</acronym> for jMonkeyEngine 3 game development
            </li>
            <li>Easy update to current plugin and jme3 versions (stable+svn) via update center
            </li>
            <li>One unifying development platform that prevents scattered content design projects (like in jme2)
            </li>
            <li>A platform for plugins: jMonkeyPlatform is a stand-alone download that can be extend with plugins
            </li>
            <li>Independent development possibilities by using NetBeans platform plugin <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym>
            </li>
        </ul>

Tip: to create a link which will open in an external web browser, try:
<object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
    <param name="content" value="http://www.netbeans.org/">
    <param name="text" value="<html><u>http://www.netbeans.org/</u></html>">
    <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
    <param name="textColor" value="blue">
</object>
To create a link to a help set from another module, you need to know the code name base and path, e.g.:
<a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/configure/configure_options.html">Using the Options Window</a>
(This link will behave sanely if that module is disabled or missing.)
